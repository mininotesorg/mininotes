 * "I have it." What a phone says back when a note has arrived and been written down.

 * <p>The network can say that it took a message. It cannot say that anybody received one, and it will take
 * a message for a phone that is asleep, switched off, or no longer there. For a long time this app wrote
 * "delivered" on the network's word, and everything that leaned on that was leaning on nothing: the mark
 * that says a note is up to date, and — worse — the text two phones are taken to have agreed on, which is
 * what every merge is made against. A phone that had been handing notes to the network on behalf of
 * somebody who never got them took that person's next words for old news and set them aside in silence.
 *
 * <p>So the far end answers, and only its answer counts. Which note and which revision ride in the
 * envelope's own header, where they are sealed and signed like everything else; this is the few bytes
 * inside that say what kind of message it is.
 *
 * <p>Said after the note is written down, never before: an answer that went out ahead of the writing
 * would be a promise, and this is a receipt.
 *
 * <p>Holds no Android types, so the format is unit tested.
