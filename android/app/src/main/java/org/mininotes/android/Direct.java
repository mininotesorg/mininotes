/**
 * Straight to a device when there is a way to it, and through a relay only when there is not. See
 * docs/DIRECT.md, phase 1.
 *
 * <p>Every note used to go through a public relay, even between a PC and a phone on the same Wi-Fi, and to
 * every address a device had, relays included, even when a direct one had just taken it. Two things here
 * change that:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Saying where this device is, on the local network.</b> Each device broadcasts a few hundred bytes
 *     every round: its Maxima identity key, the port of its door ({@code DirectEndpoint}), the local address
 *     it said it from, a time, and a signature over all of it with that same identity key. No note, no name.
 *     A device that hears one takes it only from a device it is paired with, only when the signature holds,
 *     only when it came from the address it names, and only when it is fresh.</li>
 * <li><b>Direct first.</b> A note goes to a device's local address when one was heard, then to any public
 *     address the device has proved it can be reached at, then - since phase 2 - to the device's home, a PC
 *     it collects from (see {@link Home}). The first that takes it is the whole send. Only when none does does
 *     it go the way it always went: every address, relays included.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Why the identity key signs: it is the key a paired device is already known by on the transport - what
 * the pairing recorded as its contact - and the one its door opens messages with, so the key that says
 * "I am here" is the key a note to that place is sealed for. Somebody who replays an announcement from
 * another address is refused, because the address is inside what was signed; somebody who replays it from
 * the same address within two minutes says nothing that was not already true.
 *
 * <p>A local address taking a note is not the note arriving, any more than a relay taking it was: the far
 * device still answers when it has written it down (see {@link Receipt}), and what is not answered is sent
 * again, as before. So a device on the network that pretends to be the door costs time, never a note.
 *
 * <p>Holds no Android types: the format, its bounds and the order of trying are unit tested.
