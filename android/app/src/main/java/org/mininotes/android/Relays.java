/**
 * The owner's own relays, and whether the public ones are used as well. See docs/DIRECT.md, "Your own relays".
 *
 * <p>A relay is somebody's machine that holds a connection open for a device nobody can reach. The ones
 * Mininotes starts from are the transport's public list, one operator's choice; anybody can run one, and an
 * owner who does - or who trusts a friend's - can put it here. Their relays are tried first. With the public
 * relays switched off, this device attaches to theirs and nothing else, and what cannot go directly or
 * through them waits.
 *
 * <p>Nothing in the transport is changed for this. It learns relays three ways - the list it is started
 * with, the peers each relay names when it greets (gossip), and the peers it saved from earlier runs - and
 * all three reach the pool of relays it attaches from through one listener on its discovery, which is
 * public. {@link Choice} takes that listener over, so a relay that is not the owner's is never even a
 * candidate while the public relays are off; it stops discovery itself then, so nothing is dialled to check
 * a public relay either; and it hands the pool its relays as ordinary candidates rather than as the
 * transport's "floor", which cannot be taken back once given.
 *
 * <p>An address is kept only if a Maxima greeting came back from it when it was added. An address that never
 * answered is almost always mistyped, and one kept anyway would sit in the list looking like a relay that
 * works. So there is one path: it answers, it is kept; it does not, nothing changes and it is said why.
 *
 * <p>The parsing, the saved form and the rules of choosing hold no Android types and are unit tested; so
 * is {@link Choice}, against a real node on this machine.
