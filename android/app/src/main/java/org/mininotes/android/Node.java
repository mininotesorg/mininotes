/**
 * This pad, as a node on the Maxima network.
 *
 * <p>The address was asked of other apps for a long time and the answer was always somebody else's to give:
 * Minima Core has no Maxima in its build at all, and the transport app answers only apps signed with its
 * own key. Both of those are somebody else's decision about this app. So the app stopped asking. The
 * transport is a library — Java 11, no dependencies, made to be embedded — and Mininotes now carries it,
 * the way the transport's own phone app does. The address is not fetched. It is simply known, because this
 * is the thing that has one.
 *
 * <p>Two things the platform will not supply, injected rather than depended on:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>SHA3-256</b>, which Android has at no version — see {@link Sha3}. The core checks any hash it
 *       is handed against a published answer before it will use one, because a subtly wrong hash makes this
 *       phone a different phone on the network, quietly.</li>
 *   <li><b>Where to keep things</b>: the app's own folder, so a contact and an address survive the process
 *       being killed, which on a phone is whenever the system feels like it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Starting means attaching to relays over the network, which takes as long as it takes. Nothing here is
 * ever called from the interface thread: {@link #address} is handed to {@link Background}, like every other
 * slow thing in this app.
