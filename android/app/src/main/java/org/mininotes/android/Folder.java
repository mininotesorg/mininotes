/**
 * A collection opened on Home: a rounded card over the dimmed grid, as a folder opens on a phone's desktop
 * (docs/HOME.md, step 2). Its name at the top - tapped, it becomes the field it already looks like - its mark and its ⋮,
 * then its grid, and its own + at the foot. A collection inside it opens in the same card, with ‹ and the name of the
 * one it is in to go back up (decision 21): phones do not nest folders, and a stack of cards would hide the grid they
 * belong to. Back goes up a level and then closes it; a tap on the dimmed grid closes it at once.
 *
 * <p>Where it is, is the trail MainActivity has always kept - Home, then every collection down to this one - so the way
 * back from a note, a restart and a moved thing all reopen it where it was. The Favourites collection opens the same
 * way, listing the favourites the dock has no room for; it is a place, not a collection, and is never renamed. So do the
 * archive and the bin, while they are on Home (decision 41): what waits in them, a tap on each asking where it goes from
 * there, and on the bin's ⋮, Empty the bin.
