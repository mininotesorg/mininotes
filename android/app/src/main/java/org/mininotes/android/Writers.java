 * Who wrote each letter of a note, as runs: so many letters by one writer, then so many by another.
 *
 * <p>Each letter is credited as it is typed, to whoever typed it here. A note that arrives from another device is
 * read against what this device already had, and only the letters that are new here are credited to whoever sent
 * it: the rest keep whoever they already had. The versions a note has had cannot say this - a version records who
 * sent it, not who wrote each part of it - so this is kept beside the note, on this device only. It is never sent
 * and never part of what is sent, so every device, of any version, reads what this one sends as it always did.
 *
 * <p>Text written before this was kept is nobody's: {@link #UNKNOWN}, drawn in the ordinary ink, never guessed at.
 * So is text put back from an old version, whose writers were never kept. Where the words are passed on by a third
 * person, they arrive from that person, and are theirs here: the one limit of keeping this on each device alone.
 *
 * <p>Holds no Android types, so keeping runs through every kind of edit, and reading an arrival, are unit tested.
