/**
 * Home: the app's first screen, laid out as a phone's own desktop is (docs/HOME.md, step 2). The bar as it always was;
 * under it the grid of what is on Home - its collections and notes in the owner's order, then the files that came from
 * other devices - four across; a round <b>+</b> at the foot on the right; the search bar; and the dock, with the handle
 * above it that is swiped up for the overview. A collection opens as a pop-up over the dimmed grid (see {@link Folder});
 * a note opens as the page it always was.
 *
 * <p>Everything is picked up the way the tiles were: held, the thing's menu comes up; moved while still held, it is
 * carried. Let go on a note it makes a collection of the two; on a collection it goes in; in an empty cell it stays there,
 * with the empty cells round it left empty, as a phone's home screen keeps its icons (decision 39, see {@link Layout});
 * out of a pop-up onto the dimmed grid it comes up a level; on the dock it is a favourite there. What each drop means is
 * decided in {@link Grid}; this class only measures where the finger is.
 *
 * <p>Drawn from MainActivity's own helpers, opened to the package for it, so a tile, a mark, a menu and a box look and
 * behave here exactly as they do everywhere else in the app.
