/**
 * The node kept up while the pad is closed, so a note can arrive when nobody is looking.
 *
 * <p>Maxima is not a shelf: nothing waits anywhere for this phone to come and fetch it. A note sent while
 * nobody is attached is a note a relay took in on behalf of nobody. So for as long as the node lived only
 * while the pad was on screen, sharing worked when two people happened to have the app open together and
 * did nothing at all when they did not — demonstrable rather than usable.
 *
 * <p>Android will let a process stay up for this on one condition, which is that it says so: a notification
 * for as long as it lasts. That is the right condition. It is up only while there is somebody to hear from —
 * a pad that has never been paired with anything has nothing to listen for and keeps nothing running — and
 * it can be switched off from Profile, or from the notification itself, which is where a person looking at
 * it and wondering is already standing.
 *
 * <p>The node itself is {@link Node}'s, and belongs to the process rather than to this. What this holds is
 * the process.
