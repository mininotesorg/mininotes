 * What the open note's syncing is doing, said in a few quiet words on the line under its title, after its mark

 *
 * <p>It was said at the foot of the window, on the PC's bar and the phone's strip, while the mark it was about sat
 * at the top: the eye went up to see whether the note had gone and the answer was at the bottom. Now the words are
 * beside the mark, in its colour - amber while it goes, green when it has, red when it could not - and a tap on them
 * does what a tap on the mark does. What is not about the open note stays where it was.
 *
 * <p>Holds no Android or Swing types: the phone and the PC say the same words, and they are unit tested.
