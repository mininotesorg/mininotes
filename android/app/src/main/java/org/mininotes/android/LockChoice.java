/**
 * How a locked notebook opens on this phone, as its owner chose it, and what the screens say about it.
 *
 * <p>Three ways in: the phone's own unlock (fingerprint, face, or its screen lock), a password, and the 12
 * recovery words. The words always exist. The phone's unlock comes first wherever the phone has one; the
 * password is for whoever wants it, and is never forced on anyone whose phone can do better. What must
 * never happen is a notebook that opens only with the words every day, so the last everyday way in cannot
 * be taken away - only swapped.
 *
 * <p>Holds no Android types; every rule and every sentence here is unit tested.
