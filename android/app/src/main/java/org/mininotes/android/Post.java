/**
 * Notes actually going somewhere, and notes actually arriving.

 * <p>Two layers, and they are not the same thing. Maxima carries the bytes and knows nothing of what is in
 * them. Inside that, every note is sealed for one recipient with {@link Envelope} — agreement, a key nobody
 * else can derive, and a signature that says who wrote it. A relay handles the envelope; it does not open
 * it, and could not.
 *
 * <p><b>A mark is cleared by the far phone saying it has the note, and by nothing else.</b> That rule is
 * the whole reason the marks are worth looking at. For a long time it was cleared when the network said it
 * had taken the message, which is a different thing: the network will take a message for a phone that is
 * asleep, switched off, or no longer taking that note. So a note that goes asks to be answered, the phone
 * that gets it answers once it is written down — see {@link Receipt} — and what is never answered is sent
 * again, a minute later and then less and less often, for as long as it takes.
