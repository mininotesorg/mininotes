/**
 * The icons and pictures notes and collections wear, drawn for the PC (docs/HOME.md, step 4). An icon is Lucide's path
 * data ({@link Icons}) replayed onto a {@link Path2D.Float}, scaled from its 24-unit grid to the size wanted and stroked
 * two units wide - scaled with it - with round ends and joins, never filled, in the thing's own ink. A picture is decoded
 * once, made ready once at the size a face needs at the screen's own scale, and drawn with its corners rounded.
 *
 * <p>Both are kept once made: a grid of fifty icons painted again as the pointer moves over it would otherwise read the
 * same path data fifty times a paint, and decode the same pictures every time. A picture chosen here is made as
 * {@link Thumb} says - the square from the middle, Thumb's sides tried in order until one fits - and written as PNG,
 * the one kind of picture the PC can write. The phone writes WebP; this PC reads it through the ImageIO plugin the build
 * carries, and a picture it still cannot read is drawn as the icon under it.
