/**
 * Home: the PC's first screen, laid out as the phone's is and as a phone's own desktop is (docs/HOME.md, step 3). It
 * fills the window under the toolbar: the grid of what is on Home - its collections and notes in the owner's order, then
 * the files that came from other devices - in as many columns as the window holds; a round <b>+</b> at the foot on the
 * right; the search field with the overview button beside it; and the dock, with as many favourites as fit. The status
 * bar stays under all of it, where a window keeps it (decision 25). A collection opens as a card over the dimmed Home
 * (see {@link DesktopFolder}); a note opens as the page it always was, filling the window.
 *
 * <p>Every icon stands in the cell it was put in, with the empty cells between left empty, as a phone's own home screen
 * keeps them (decision 39, {@link Layout}). Every icon is picked up the way the phone's are: pressed and moved, it is
 * carried. Let go in an empty cell it stays there; on a note it makes a collection of the two; on a collection it goes
 * in; out of a card onto the dimmed Home it comes up a level, into the cell it is let go in if that is empty; on the
 * dock it is a favourite there. What each drop means is {@link Grid}'s, shared with the phone; this class only measures
 * where the pointer is. Right-click, the Menu key or Shift+F10 gives the thing's menu - the same one, in the same order,
 * as everywhere else - and the keyboard reaches every icon: the arrows move between them, Ctrl+arrow moves the icon
 * itself a cell, Enter opens, F2 renames, Delete puts it in the bin.
 *
 * <p>Home's places stand among the icons (decision 41): the Favourites collection while the dock has no room for every
 * favourite, and the archive and the bin unless they are switched off in Settings, each with how many things wait in it.
 * Each opens as a card of what is in it; a thing let go on the Archive is archived, on the Bin it goes in the bin. A
 * place is carried to another empty cell as any icon is (decision 42), and into nothing.
